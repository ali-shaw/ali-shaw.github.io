Hello World! Look! I'm a `web developer` now! Welcome to my site! Read more to find out why I'm doing this!

The **reason** this blog has come to _actual_ fruition is my article [How Datadog Saved My Wedding]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /blog/2019-6-7-How-Datadog-Saved-My-Wedding %}). The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing customers/prospects find new and wonderful use cases for Datadog every day - when I had my own use case I couldn't not share it!

That said, the **idea** of a blog has been a long time coming. I want to be able to share thoughts from work/dev focussed projects, opinion pieces and general rantings... As with any "wannabe blogger" I have come very close to a blog in the past - spending more time assessing platforms/designs/domains than actually writing anything! That said - it's been a cool learning curve, this site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"} which has been a fun experience getting to grips with!

So here we go, make yourself at home, have a read, let me know what you think<br>
 ##note to self: find way to setup commenting/feedback##

 Enjoy!<br>
 Ali
