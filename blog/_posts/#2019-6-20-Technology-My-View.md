title: Technology - My View

Technology forms a huge part of my life. It always has. From the excitement of my first Dell Inspiron 1500, to the endless home automation of smart light bulbs and voice assistants that run my house today. My earliest fond memory of technology however goes back to a family holiday in the South of France. Picture the scene: glorious sunshine, away from school and homework, a young teenage Ali is lying by the hotel pool without a care in the world. When suddenly, a young, attractive woman emerges from the pool and walks over to her lounge chair near his.

Me, being the techy I am, am immediate drawn to... the strange device she then picks up, connects to earphones and starts listening to music on. It wasn't a bulky cassette player, nor the distinctive circular shape of a Sony Walkman. No, it's smaller than palm size. I immediately needed to know what it was - my inner geek curious at this new discovery. So of course, I did what any true nerd would do... I got up and walked straight over... to the hotel PC and starting using our allocated internet minutes (this was before free WiFi!) to frantically Google what this mysterious device could possibly be. I then ran back out to the pool to my mum and insisted that as soon as we got home, I wanted an _iPod Shuffle_ and then spent the next 20 minutes explaining the benefits of Flash Memory, MP3 formats and the ability to store an entire library of music on one device - not being restricted by physical CDs.

Fast forward several years and here I am, still as fascinated about technology. It encompasses my personal life, as well as my professional life. In both areas I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest advancements; and most importantly, constantly curious at what drives the way people are connecting with technology. This blog post is my philosophical take on technology, why it has taken such a prominent place in our current society and what is fuelling this techno-culture.

# Social Acceptance
There are a lot of forces that push technology and its adoption forwards - how accessible it is, how it aligns to generational beliefs, its cultural and ethical implications
